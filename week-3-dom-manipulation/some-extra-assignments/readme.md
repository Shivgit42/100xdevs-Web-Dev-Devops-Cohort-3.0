## Important

### These extra assignments was not given in cohort 3 or given by harkirat. These extra assignments I found on from cohort 2.0 repo which I tried to do and was kinda interesting to me, that's why I did all of the assignments, If you want to deep dive more and improve your hands-on code into DOM, thses are definitely few good assignmengts to look at.
